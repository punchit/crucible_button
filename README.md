# crucible-button

An ethereum based application that allows participants to commit
to pressing a button every day.  If they meet that goal, after the period
is up, they will get their funds back.  If they don't meet that goal they
loose their funds.  Those that meet the goal get a portion of the funds
of those that failed to meet the goal.

The project is an example of how crucibles on the ethereum network can be used.
